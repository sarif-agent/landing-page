# Landing Page (css-project)

# Project Overview

Hello! I've completed the CSS fundamentals, and this Landing Page project was my latest achievement. I created this Landing Page entirely using HTML, CSS, and Flexbox technologies. My goal was to build the skeleton of the website based on the provided reference by TOP curriculum. Once the skeleton was complete, I adorned the site with my preferred theme, fonts, and content. 

# Key Features

In this project, I also incorporated some small style enhancements, such as:

- I created every photo/image used in this project with AI generator. Such as Midjourney.
- Some custom font styles that goes perfectly with the theme.
- Implemented hover effects that I hadn't learned in Odin Project yet.
- Utilized border-radius to give elements a more polished appearance.
- Enhanced user experience with custom cursor properties.

# Usage

You can check out the project by opening the `github pages` link provided in About section. 

# Future Improvements

I plan to continue refining this Landing Page and adding more interactive elements in the future.
